# Pyintegration

Welcome to the Pyintegration project. This code is an extension to the Python unittest framework that enables integration testing easy.

## Background

The origins of this came from the [CloudTruth CLI](https://github.com/cloudtruth/cloudtruth-cli) integration tests. The framework was adapated elsewhere to integration test Helidon containers, and this work largely reflects (or will reflect) those enhancements.

## Uses

The intention of this framework is to provide a means of quickly tests.

## Features

Here are the features that Pyintegration supports:
* Setup/Cleanup
* Report generation
* Data capture

### Setup/Cleanup

The Setup/Cleanup functions are part of most test frameworks. These parts of the framework help insure that prerequisite resources are in place NOT stranded

### Report Generation

Running the tests 

### Data Capture
